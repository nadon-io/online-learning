    "\n",
    "1. Interactively in a terminal (good for simple one-line interactions)\n",
    "2. Interactively writing code within a Jupyter Notebook (best for single-file projects which benefit from easy editing and visualization)\n",
    "3. Writing `*.py` files using a text editor such as VsCode and then running them (best for complex / structured projects)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive terminal session\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to call an interactive Python REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) shell by simply entering `Python` (or `Python3` if not on Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to enter Python code line-by-line and is great for quickly computing short one-line commands. Anything more complex quickly becomes inefficient to do in the interactive shell.\n",

Once you type `math.name_of_func(` it should auto-complete the second paranthesis, as well as provide information on the function (such as its return type).\n",

    "**FYI:** VSCode offers many, many features for writing code, such as auto-formatting your code, changing indentation from tabs to spaces, etc.. All of these features can be seen by bringing up the command palette by pressing `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` on your keyboard (replace `ctrl` with `command` for MacOS). These available commands can then be filtered by entering text into the field, I suggest entering \"Jupyter Notebook\" into the command palette and seeing what you get!"
